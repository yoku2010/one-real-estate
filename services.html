                                        <h4>Property Listing</h4>
                                        <p>There are three main types of clients that 1 Real Estate Network sees regularly: buyers, sellers and renters. Here is a bit of information about how property listings work for each of these categories of clients.</p>
                                        
                                        <h5 class="orange">Buyers</h5>
                                        <p>It is most common for buyers to begin by browsing through the listings on the 1 Real Estate Network website before contacting us, but we always encourage new clients to stop by our local office to discuss the property type they are searching for.</p>
                                        <p>If you have seen a property you are interested in on our website, please contact us to discuss further details about the property such as pricing, availability and features.</p>

                                        <h5 class="orange">Sellers</h5>
                                        <p>Now that you've found the best local real estate agent, it's time to learn how to go about creating your property listing with us.</p>
                                        <p>There are several types of listings you may choose from, including an exclusive right-to-sell listing, an exclusive agency listing, or an open listing. The best way to choose which is right for you is to set up an appointment to speak with a realtor in person about the property you are selling, and to take it from there.</p>

                                        <p><span class="bold">If You Choose An Exclusive Right-To-Sell Listing:</span> This is the most popular type of agreement we offer when it comes to property listings, and gives a 1 Real Estate Network broker exclusive rights to represent and sell your property. This agreement puts 100% of our resources and expertise behind the sale of your home, meaning you're guaranteed our best results.</p>

                                        <p><span class="bold">If You Choose An Exclusive Agency Listing:</span> Under this type of agreement for property listings, one of our real estate brokers would represent your property exclusively, though you would still have the right as the owner to complete a sale yourself.</p>

                                        <p><span class="bold">If You Choose an Open Listing:</span> Under this type of agreement for property listings, there are few services provided past the actual listing of the property. This course of action is not generally recommended as many such properties stay on the market for years.</p>

                                        <p>Our realty experts know how to sell local Succasunna homes quickly and effectively, and are eager to help you complete the most hassle-free sale possible.</p>

                                        <h5 class="orange">Renters</h5>
                                        <p>Whether looking to list a property for rent, or find a property to rent yourself, most of our renters begin by browsing through the listings on the 1 Real Estate Network website before contacting us, but we encourage you to drop by our offices to discuss your rental requirements further.</p>

This can be a great source of extra income, a big help in paying down a mortgage or a simple solution to putting off selling a property you aren't quite sure about.

Whatever the reason for renting, there are a number of factors to consider before putting a listing up for the property, and our realtors are here to help.</p>
                                        <h5 class="orange">Some of the most important questions we will help you answer are:</h5>

                                        <p>"What kind of tenant(s) do I want?"</p>
                                        <p>"How long do I plan to rent my property for?"</p>
